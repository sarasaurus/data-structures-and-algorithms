## Fizz Buzz
Write a function called FizzBuzzTree which takes a tree as an argument.
Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, determine weather or not the value of each node is divisible by 3, 5 or both, and change the value of each of the nodes respectively. Return the tree with itâ€™s new values.

## Examples
if the value is 3 or 9 etc, it should change to 'fizz'  
if the value is 5 or 20 etc, it should change to 'buzz'
if the value is 15 or 30 etc, it should change to 'fizzbuzz'
if the value is 2, or 4 or 7 etc etc, it should stay 2


## BigO
- Time: O of N, where N is the number of nodes in the tree
- Space: O of H, where H is height of the tree
