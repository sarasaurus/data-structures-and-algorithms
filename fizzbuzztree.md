## Fizz Buzz
Conduct “FizzBuzz” on a tree while traversing through it. Change the values of each of the nodes dependent on the current node’s value for multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number and for the multiples of five print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz", if neither leave the node unchanged

## BigO
- Time: O of N, where N is the number of nodes in the tree
- Space: O of H, where H is height of the tree
